"""
Canonical Test Suite for HWKG and Dataflow Modeling

This test suite provides comprehensive validation of the Hardware Kernel Generator
and Interface-Wise Dataflow Modeling systems based on current implementation
and the axioms defined in INTERFACE_WISE_DATAFLOW_AXIOMS.md.

Test Organization:
- axioms/: Axiom-based validation tests
- dataflow/: Dataflow modeling system tests  
- hwkg/: Hardware Kernel Generator tests
- examples/: Example-based validation tests
- performance/: Performance regression tests

All tests are designed to validate the current working implementation
rather than outdated documentation, ensuring system reliability.
