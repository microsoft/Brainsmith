"""Fast integration tests for DSE tree construction.

Phase 3: Placeholder created
Phase 5: Will be implemented with:
  - test_linear_tree - Build tree from linear steps
  - test_branching_tree - Build tree with branch points
  - test_multi_level_branching - Complex branching structures
  - test_segment_id_determinism - Cache key consistency (critical!)
  - test_tree_statistics - Node counts and depth validation

Port from: OLD_FOR_REFERENCE_ONLY/integration/test_dse_execution.py (tree building tests)

Marker: @pytest.mark.fast
Execution time: < 1 min (no FINN execution)
