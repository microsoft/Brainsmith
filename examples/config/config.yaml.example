# Brainsmith User Configuration Example
# 
# Copy this file to ~/.brainsmith/config.yaml and customize as needed.
# 
# Configuration Priority (highest to lowest):
# 1. Blueprint-level configuration (in your blueprint YAML)
# 2. User configuration (this file when placed at ~/.brainsmith/config.yaml)
# 3. Environment variables (BRAINSMITH_MAX_COMBINATIONS, BRAINSMITH_TIMEOUT_MINUTES)
# 4. Built-in defaults

# Maximum number of combinations allowed in a design space
# This prevents accidental creation of extremely large design spaces
# that could take days or weeks to explore.
# Default: 100000
max_combinations: 1000000

# Default timeout for DSE jobs in minutes
# Individual blueprints can override this in their search or global sections.
# Default: 60 (1 hour)
timeout_minutes: 120

# Future configuration options can be added here as needed
# Examples might include:
# - default_parallel_builds: 4
# - default_working_directory: ~/brainsmith_work
# - default_log_level: INFO
